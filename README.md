# MaticServices-Mobile-Coding-Challenge
Mobile Coding Challenge. I'm ready for it! 

Hey All!
I created this app using many libraries:
1-lifecycle
2-glide for image
3-recyclerview
4-Shimmer
5-fancy toast message

I'm aware that the app could be done using RX JAva library so we don't interrupt th main thread but I have thought that we only have one view (not worth it in this app)

I have created many branched on i can divide the app into small parts.
I used MVVM architecture and custome Recycle View.

Easter Egg In The APP!

NOTE: I have some problems implemnting Unit Testing so I skipped it in order not to submit something broken.

Feel free to add comments to my code so I can lear and develop my self :D
Thank you!
